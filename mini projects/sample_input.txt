Client Project Brief

The client is planning to construct a mid-sized residential building on a plot of approximately 4,500 sqft. 
The building is expected to have ground plus three floors (G+3) with a total built-up area close to 10,000 sqft.

The primary use of the building will be residential apartments, with one 3BHK unit per floor.
The client has mentioned a tentative construction budget of around 1.2 million USD, but this may be adjusted 
based on material choices and final design decisions.

Parking space for at least 6 cars is required on the ground floor. 
The client has also expressed interest in having a small landscaped area and rooftop access.

At this stage, the client has not finalized the exact floor heights, structural system, 
or local zoning and building regulations. These details are expected to be discussed later.
